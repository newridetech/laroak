# Silicon Framework

In the era of growing number of regulations, privacy awareness and security
restrictions we felt like it was a good time to introduce the new and
responsible approach to handle sensible data while developing custom tailored
solutions. Our goal is to handle good security and privacy management practices 
and to do it in a way the will make app development and maintenance simpler 
instead of making it harder or more complicated.

Silicon can be viewed as a glue layer between [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) 
and [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org). Those technologies combined
provide every required aspect to handle application security, identity 
management and ease of development. It is simple to develop new features and
maintain the app and most probably Silicon will boost your performance but
it's not aimed at everyone, especially not at coding beginners.

Silicon does not reinvent concepts, it just stands on shoulders of giants. 
What it provides is the separation of concerns and modular 
[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) code divided into bundles with security and
identity management concepts included by design. It would probably require
some effort (although it's possible) to include Silicon into an existing 
project but if you are thinking about creating a fresh codebase or new API / 
webapp version it may be a choice worth considering.
